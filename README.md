# Migrate Java EE App to Azure

You will find here a full training workshop on migrating an existing Java EE application to Azure, 
including guides and demos. You will migrate:
 
- Java EE application to App Service Linux and 
- Application's data to Azure Database for PostgreSQL, MySQL and or SQL Database. 

## What you should expect

This is not the official documentation but an opinionated training.

It is a hands-on training, and it will use the command line extensively. 
The idea is to get coding very quickly and play with the platform, 
from a simple demo to far more complex examples.

After completing all the guides, you should have a fairly good understanding of 
everything that Azure offers for running Java EE applications on PaaS without worrying
about the underlying infrastructure or monitoring applications.

You will migrate the famous [Sun's 2003 Java EE Blue Print](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-blueprint.html) 
sample application. The most recent incarnation of the sample application uses:

- Java SE 8
- Java EE 7
- JSR 338 Java Persistence API (JPA 2.2)
- JSR 346 Context and Dependency Injection (CDI 1.1)
- JSR 345 Enterprise Java Beans 3.2 (EJB 3.2)
- JSR 344 Java Server Faces (JSF 2.2) 
- JSR 339 Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS 2.0)
- Twitter Bootstrap (Bootstrap 3.x, JQuery 2.x, PrimeFaces 6.x) 

Upon migration, you will power the app using 
Azure Database for PostgreSQL, MySQL and or SQL Database.

## Petstore is back!

This Java EE Petstore sample is forked from 
[agoncal/agoncal-application-petstore-ee7](https://github.com/agoncal/agoncal-application-petstore-ee7) - see [Petstore README](./README-petstoreee7.md). 

> When you create something and give it away, you lose control of what you've created and then, anything can happen.
> 
> I created this Petstore application years ago to show how Java EE components would work all together. 
> I used this application in many talks, workshops, demos... and then, time passed, I forgot about it and never updated it.
> I've written this code when monoliths were a thing, when the cloud was just starting, and when the only CI/CD tool we had was called Hudson.
> 
> Today, thanks to the Azure team, my Petstore application is built with GitHub actions and deployed to the cloud.
> Without changing the original code, and with only a few commands and some configuration, you can deploy the application to Azure.
> What a journey!
> 
> Thank you,
>
